### 3.2 CNN-Based Detection Models

#### 3.2.1 ResNet50 Architecture
We implement a ResNet50-based detector with a custom classification head. The model leverages pre-trained weights from ImageNet and fine-tunes for deepfake detection:

```python
class CNNDeepfakeDetector(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name="resnet50", num_classes=2, pretrained=True):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = models.resnet50(pretrained=pretrained)
        self.feature_dim = self.backbone.fc.in_features
        self.backbone.fc = nn.Identity()
        
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(self.feature_dim, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(512, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
        )
```

#### 3.2.2 Multi-Scale CNN
To capture artifacts at different resolutions, we implement a multi-scale CNN that processes images at multiple scales simultaneously:

```python
class MultiScaleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.scale_1 = self._create_branch(224, 64)  # Fine details
        self.scale_2 = self._create_branch(112, 128)  # Medium details
        self.scale_3 = self._create_branch(56, 256)   # Coarse details
        
        total_features = 64 + 128 + 256
        self.fusion = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(total_features, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(512, num_classes)
        )
```

#### 3.2.3 Temporal CNN
For video sequence analysis, we implement a temporal CNN that models temporal consistency:

```python

    def __init__(self, backbone_name="resnet50", sequence_length=16):
        super().__init__()
        self.spatial_extractor = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
        self.spatial_extractor.fc = nn.Identity()
        
        self.temporal_conv = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv1d(self.feature_dim, 256, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv1d(256, 128, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)
        )
```

### 3.3 Transformer-Based Detection Models

    def __init__(self, model_name="google/vit-base-patch16-224"):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = ViTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.feature_dim = self.backbone.config.hidden_size
        
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Dropout(0.1),
            nn.Linear(self.feature_dim, 512),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.1),
            nn.Linear(512, 128),
            nn.GELU(),

        super().__init__()
        self.models = nn.ModuleList(models)
        if weights is None:
            weights = [1.0 / len(models)] * len(models)
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(weights))
    
    def forward(self, x):
        predictions = []
        for model in self.models:
            predictions.append(model(x))
        
        weighted_pred = sum(w * pred for w, pred in zip(self.weights, predictions))
        return weighted_pred
```

#### 3.4.2 Learned Fusion Ensemble
We also implement a learned fusion ensemble where a neural network learns optimal combination weights:

    def __init__(self, models, fusion_dim=128):
        super().__init__()
        self.models = nn.ModuleList(models)
        self.fusion_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(len(models), fusion_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(fusion_dim, 2)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        predictions = []
        for model in self.models:
            predictions.append(model(x))
        
        # Stack predictions and learn fusion
        stacked_preds = torch.stack(predictions, dim=-1)
        fusion_output = self.fusion_network(stacked_preds)
        return fusion_output
```

### 3.5 Synthetic Data Generation

        self.face_generator = FaceGenerator(config)
        self.background_generator = BackgroundGenerator(config)
        self.artifact_generator = ArtifactGenerator(config)
    
    def generate_fake_samples(self, num_samples):
        samples = []
        for i in range(num_samples):
            # Generate synthetic face
            face = self.face_generator.generate_face()
            background = self.background_generator.generate_background()
            composite = self._composite_face_background(face, background)
            
            # Add artifacts typical of deepfakes
            composite = self.artifact_generator.add_compression_artifacts(composite)
            composite = self.artifact_generator.add_noise(composite)
            composite = self.artifact_generator.add_blur(composite)
            
            samples.append(composite)
        return samples
```

        recall = recall_score(self.targets, self.predictions, average='weighted')
        f1 = f1_score(self.targets, self.predictions, average='weighted')
        roc_auc = roc_auc_score(self.targets, self.probabilities)
        
        return {
            'accuracy': accuracy,
            'precision': precision,

        self.detection_times.append(detection_time)
        self.predictions.append(prediction)
        self.targets.append(target)
    
    def get_fps(self):
        if len(self.frame_times) < 2:
            return 0.0
        time_diff = self.frame_times[-1] - self.frame_times[0]
