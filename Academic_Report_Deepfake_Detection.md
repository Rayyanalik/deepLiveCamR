        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = models.resnet50(pretrained=pretrained)
        self.feature_dim = self.backbone.fc.in_features
        self.backbone.fc = nn.Identity()
        
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(self.feature_dim, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),

        total_features = 64 + 128 + 256
        self.fusion = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(total_features, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
